## User needs for the sales team 

**For sales teams:**

We want to be able to view last three yearsâ€™ sales performances throught time (year, quarter, month, day) so that we can plan on three year strategy about sales and boost best sellers activities
The project should identity : 
- the top 10 product categories which generate more revenue and the bottom 10 product categories
- the top 10 sellers and the bottom 10 sellers
- the review_score and test the impact of delivery service on it

The analysis should include a breakdown of sales (number of orders and turnover) by region
